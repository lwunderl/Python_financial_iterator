Two iterators are included in this project.<br>
The financial iterator folder contains a Resources and Analysis folder for the inputs and outputs of a program called financial.py. This iterator loops through budget_data.csv and returns an output file.<br>

Three arguments are required on the command line to run.<ul>
<li>1st argument is the program, main.py.</br>
<li>2nd argument is the data file to analyze, data.csv.</br>
<li>3rd argument is the text file name to output, your_name_file.txt</ul>
Example: python filepath\main.py filepath\data.csv filepath\your_file.txt</br>
The program will print a report to the terminal and create a report file named in command line argument 3.
